Through the study of Experiment 1, we learned how the operating system works when the computer starts and how the computer manages the memory.

In Chapter 1, we will discuss Computer Boot, Boot Loader and The Kernel in detail. We will start research on the X86 assembly instructions, BIOS execution, PC physical address space, how the Boot Loader loads the kernel, the connection address and load address, the use of virtual memory, the formatted output of the console, and the stack.

In Chapter 2, we will discuss physical page management, virtual memory, and kernel address space. Describe in detail the relationship between virtual addresses and linear and physical addresses, reference counts, page table management, permissions and fault isolation, initialization of linear portions of the kernel, and so on.
